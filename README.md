# SunRiseIDE

This project consists of three primary components: an ARM emulator and an assembler written in C, and an extension IDE that is used to debug, compile and write Assembly code.

The emulator simulates the ARM processor, decoding and executing instructions from a given file. The assembler converts assembly language to machine code.
